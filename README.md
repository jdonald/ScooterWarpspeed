## Scooter Warpspeed

### Description

Originally imagined as an augmented reality demo that would
detect your speed on a self-balancing electric scooter, Scooter
Warpspeed also used the Dragonfly prototype. The project would
display “warp speed” stars flying past you as you went forward
on the scooter. (We have several of these scooters around the
office and our engineers love them — pedestrians beware!) Due
to safety concerns, the team ultimately decided to make it into
a sit-down space simulator where stars, comets, space dust, and
planets fly past you. Occasionally, you get surrounded by a
burst of thousands of stars.

### Prerequisites

- Rift DK2
- Oculus Runtime 0.5.0.1 or newer
- Windows

### Building

- Unity 5.0.2f1

Building with more recent versions of Unity will probably
require some upkeep, considering built-in VR support was
added in Unity 5.1!
